Revised December 26, 2022. ② The term of office of by-elected officers and members shall be the remaining period of the term of office of their predecessor. ③ If a member pursuant to Article 5 is dismissed or recommended for replacement by the relevant organization, the committee shall also automatically dismiss the member. ④ The President of the Korea Sports Council (hereinafter referred to as *Chairman) may dismiss a committee member whose participation in meetings is less than 50% without justifiable cause.
