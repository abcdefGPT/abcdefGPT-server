    "contents": "Article 34 (Application for reconsideration, etc.) ① If a person suspected of disciplinary action is dissatisfied with the disciplinary action initially decided by the Category Committee or City/Provincial Committee, or the disciplinary action initially decided by the committee, the purpose and reason for applying for reconsideration and the method of proof shall be specified. You can apply for reconsideration to the committee. In this case, if the primary reason for disciplinary action is a violation of rights and interests, the victim may also apply for reconsideration to the committee. Revised December 26, 2022. ② An application for reconsideration under paragraph (1) must be made within 7 days from the date of receipt of the disciplinary decision regarding the disciplinary matters decided in the first instance. ③ The Committee shall hold a committee meeting to deliberate and decide within 60 days from the date of receiving the application for reconsideration pursuant to paragraph (1). ④ If the committee receives an application for reconsideration and deliberates on disciplinary matters initially decided by the Sports Committee or City/Provincial Committee, the existing disciplinary action will be respected, but if the disciplinary action is extremely unfair or illegal, it may be increased or reduced. However, if only the person suspected of disciplinary action applies for reconsideration for the first disciplinary matter, the punishment cannot be increased, and if only the victim applies for reconsideration, the exemption cannot be reduced. Revised January 24, 2022. ⑤ When the committee receives and deliberates a request for reconsideration of disciplinary matters initially decided, the disciplinary action may be increased or reduced in consideration of new evidence and the degree of explanation. ⑥ If the Committee determines that disciplinary action by the Category Committee or City/Provincial Committee is in violation of the standards of this regulation or is extremely unfair, it shall decide to reconsider by its authority or request the relevant committee to reconsider, even if there is no application for reconsideration. In this case, the relevant committee must convene and process the committee within one month and report the results. Revised January 31, 2019, January 24, 2022. ⑦ If necessary for reconsideration under paragraph 4, the Committee may request additional investigation or data from the primary disciplinary decision-making body and related persons.
